            <p>The Matrix 4 plot will put us about 60 years after the events of Matrix Revolutions. For many of the humans living outside the computer program, a literal lifetime has passed. But, of course, the Matrix has been rebooted, something we knew at the end of Revolutions. </p>
            <p>In this new timeline, there have been significant changes from the world we last left. Not all are still alive and the “world” has a divergent feel from the one Neo first entered all those years ago. </p>
            <p>The Matrix 4 plot will set us up with the beginning of a story in a world that definitely looks different than when we last left it. </p>
